* Queen Elizabeth the Second
    * Queen of Canada

* The Oath
    * I swear (or affirm)
    * That I will be faithful
    * And bear true allegiance
    * To Her Majesty
    * Queen Elizabeth the Second
    * Queen of Canada
    * Her Heirs and Successors
    * And that I will faithfully observe
    * The laws of Canada
    * Including the Constitution
    * Which recognizes and affirms
    * The Aboriginal and treaty rights of
    * First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis peoples
    * And fulfil my duties
    * As a Canadian citizen. 

* Understanding the **Oath**
    * In Canada, we **profess our loyalty to a person who represents all Canadians** and not to a document such as a constitution, a banner such as a flag, or a geopolitical entity such as a country. In our **constitutional monarchy**, these elements are encompassed by the Sovereign (Queen or King)
        * Constitutional monarchy, system of government in which a monarch (see monarchy) shares power with a constitutionally organized government. The monarch may be the de facto **head of state or a purely ceremonial leader**. The constitution allocates the rest of the government's power to the legislature and judiciary.
        * A **constitutional monarchy, parliamentary monarchy, or democratic monarchy** is a form of monarchy in which the monarch exercises his authority in **accordance with a constitution** and is not alone in deciding.
        * Constitutional monarchy may refer to a system in which the monarch acts as a non-party political head of state under the constitution, whether written or unwritten. While most monarchs may hold formal authority and the government may legally operate in the monarch's name, in the form typical in Europe the monarch no longer personally sets public policy or chooses political leaders. Political scientist Vernon Bogdanor, paraphrasing Thomas Macaulay, has defined a constitutional monarch as "A sovereign who reigns but does not rule".
        * A **monarch is a head of state for life or until abdication**, and therefore the head of state of a monarchy. A monarch may exercise the **highest authority and power in the state**, or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Usually a monarch either personally **inherits the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights** (often referred to as the throne or the crown) or is selected by an established process **from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch**. Alternatively, an individual may proclaim themself monarch, which may be backed and legitimated through acclamation, right of conquest or a combination of means.
    
    * Canada is personified by the Sovereign just as the Sovereign is personified by Canada.

* How old is Canada?
    * You might hear people say that Canada is turning 153 years old this year. What this really means is that we're celebrating the 153rd anniversary of the **Constitution Act of 1867**, which established Canada as a country. In actuality, this place is a whole lot older than 150 years!

* For 400 years, settlers and immigrants have contributed to the diversity and richness of our country, which is built on a proud history and a strong identity.

* Canada is a constitutional monarchy, a parliamentary democracy and a federal state. Canadians are bound together by a shared commitment to the rule of law and to the institutions of parliamentary government.
    * Constitution: a body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is acknowledged to be governed.
    * Constitutional monarchy, system of government in which a monarch (see monarchy) shares power with a constitutionally organized government. The monarch may be the de facto **head of state or a purely ceremonial leader**. The constitution allocates the rest of the government's power to the **legislature and judiciary**.
